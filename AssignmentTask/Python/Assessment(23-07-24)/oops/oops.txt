-> our program around function i.e Blocks of statements that manipulate data. 
This is called the procedure-oriented way of programming.

-> There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and warp it inside something 
called an object. This is called as object-oriented programming.

oops's concept:
1. Class:-> class is a collection of an object.
         -> A class is a blueprint for how something should be defined.
         -> A classes define the function called methods, which identitfy.
         the behaviour that an object created from the class can perform with its data.

2. Objects:-> objects are anything that has properties and same behaviours
           -> properties of objects -> variable
           -> behaviours -> functions of he object
           -> the properties that all objects have are defined in A method called __init__()
           -> __init__ sets the initial state of object.
